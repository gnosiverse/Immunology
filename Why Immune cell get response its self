I see what you’re asking now! You're asking about how memory cells can trigger an immune response in the absence of a pathogen or without a direct threat like an infection, particularly in the case of allergies.

Here’s how that works:

Memory Cells in Allergy Reactions
In allergies, the immune system responds as though it’s under attack by a harmful pathogen, even though the allergen is not actually dangerous. This process involves IgE memory cells (specifically memory B cells that produce IgE antibodies) and mast cells, but they react to an allergen instead of a pathogen.

First Exposure: When you first come into contact with an allergen (like pollen, pet dander, or certain foods), your immune system mistakenly recognizes it as a harmful invader. Your B cells produce IgE antibodies, which are unique to that allergen. These antibodies then attach to mast cells (found in tissues such as your skin, lungs, and digestive system).

Memory Formation: After the initial exposure, your immune system creates memory cells that "remember" the allergen. These memory cells are primarily IgE-producing memory B cells.

Subsequent Exposure (Even Without a Pathogen): The next time you're exposed to the same allergen, your immune system "remembers" the allergen through the IgE antibodies on the mast cells, even though the allergen is not a pathogen. The allergen binds to the IgE on these cells, triggering them to release chemicals like histamine.

Immune Response Without a Pathogen: This release of histamine and other chemicals leads to the symptoms of an allergic reaction (like swelling, itching, sneezing, or more severe reactions). The allergen hasn’t caused an infection, but your immune system is reacting inappropriately as though it’s a harmful pathogen.

Why Memory Cells Respond Without the Pathogen
Memory cells don't always need a pathogen to trigger a response. In the case of allergies:

The IgE antibodies produced by memory B cells act like a "signal" for the immune system to react when they encounter their specific allergen.
The memory cells themselves don’t need to detect an actual infection or pathogen to trigger the response. Instead, they react when they encounter a harmless substance that the immune system has mistakenly identified as a threat.
So, in an allergic reaction, the immune system is essentially "self-triggering" due to the IgE memory of the allergen, even though there is no pathogen present. This is an overactive immune response to a harmless substance, which is what leads to the symptoms of an allergy.
